### What if I don't find what I'm looking for?

Try these tips:
- **Expand your search radius**: "Can you search within 20 miles?"
- **Be more specific**: Instead of "haircut", try "barber specializing in fades"

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find any businesses near you"

**Solutions:**
1. Expand your search radius: "Search within 25 miles"
2. Try a broader service type: "Any hair salons?" instead of "Balayage specialists"
3. Try a nearby city: "What about in Scottsdale instead?"

### "The times shown don't work for me"

**Solutions:**
1. Ask for different days: "What about next week?"
2. Request specific times: "Do they have early morning or evening slots?"
3. Ask about waitlist: "Can I be added to a cancellation list?"

### "I selected the wrong business"

**Solution:**
Just say: "Actually, I want to go back and choose a different business"

RouterGPT will show you the list again.
